Sealed class A sealed class is a class (marked with the sealed keyword) which cannot be inherited from. If the intention is to not have a class available for inheritance (probably the majority of classes by default) the class should be marked as sealed to prevent unwanted effects of it being inherited - but there is the benefit of some performance improvements.</description></item><item><title>Performant logging with LoggerMessageAttribute</title><link>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/02/09-logger-message-attribute/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 01:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/02/09-logger-message-attribute/</guid><description>Daily Knowledge Drop .NET6 introduced a new attribute called LoggerMessageAttribute, which leverages source generators and is designed to deliver a highly useable and performant logging solution.
It works by using source generators, triggered at compile time by the presence of LoggerMessageAttribute to generate the additional source code. This solution, due to the compile time generation, is able to eliminate performance hits, such as boxing, temporary memory allocation as well as copies which enables it to be typically considerably faster than the existing run time logging methods.</description></item></channel></rss>
