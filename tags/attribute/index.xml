The pattern for usage is the same for all attributes. To extract the metadata when a method is called, the following needs to be done:
A new parameter needs to be added to the method (the type of the parameter depends on the attribute, see examples below) The new parameter must have a default value The new parameter must be decorated with the relevant Attribute Attributes Lets look at a few examples.</description></item><item><title>Performant logging with LoggerMessageAttribute</title><link>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/02/09-logger-message-attribute/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 01:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/02/09-logger-message-attribute/</guid><description>Daily Knowledge Drop .NET6 introduced a new attribute called LoggerMessageAttribute, which leverages source generators and is designed to deliver a highly useable and performant logging solution.
It works by using source generators, triggered at compile time by the presence of LoggerMessageAttribute to generate the additional source code. This solution, due to the compile time generation, is able to eliminate performance hits, such as boxing, temporary memory allocation as well as copies which enables it to be typically considerably faster than the existing run time logging methods.</description></item></channel></rss>
