Two new operators were introduced to support this functionality:
^: The index from end operator ..: The range operator ^ operator The new ^ operator is an index from end operator, which specifies that an index is relative to the end of the sequence.</description></item><item><title>Using Func&lt;> as an intermediary</title><link>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/03/23-func-as-intermediary/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 01:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/03/23-func-as-intermediary/</guid><description>Daily Knowledge Drop A Func (or Action) can be used as an intermediary to keep code cleaner when dealing with multiple methods or delegates of the same signature.
The setup The root of this post stems from a real-world situation I&amp;rsquo;d encountered. The examples below will be a simplified example of the situation but the setup is as follows:
A handler is obtained from the dependency injection container A collection of none or many interceptors are obtained from the dependency injection container If no interceptors are obtained, then Invoke a HandleOperation method on the handler If any interceptors are obtained, then build up a &amp;ldquo;pipeline&amp;rdquo; of all interceptors and then the handler at the end of the pipeline.</description></item><item><title>Dependency Injection with Func and delegates</title><link>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/03/07-di-func-delegate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 01:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/03/07-di-func-delegate/</guid><description>Daily Knowledge Drop When requiring to abstract and inject a simple single method interface using dependency injection (DI), its possible to instead use a Func&amp;lt;&amp;gt; or a Delegate instead.
Examples Suppose we want to inject the date time using dependency injection, instead of using DateTime.Now or DateTimeOffSet.Now.
There are a few reasons to do this:
DateTime.Now returns the current system datetime. This does not account for users in different regions, daylight savings etc (this is a complex subject, see the NodaTime reference below for additional information) The current datetime is an external dependency - best practice is for all external dependencies to be abstracted, so that they can be mocked and successfully unit tested There are a number of ways to tackle this requirement.</description></item></channel></rss>
