Why even lock? So why would we need to even lock? consider the following example, regarding a bank account.
The bank account has a balance, and two methods to Deposit and Withdraw money from the account.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 class Account { public int Balance { get; set; } public void Deposit(int depositAmount) { Balance += depositAmount; } public void Withdraw(int withdrawAmount) { Balance -= withdrawAmount; } } The following code simulates a high volume number of transactions on the bank account - it loops for 10000 iterations in total, creating tasks to deposit $5 and to withdraw $5.</description></item></channel></rss>
