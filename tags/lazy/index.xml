Sample Use case In our use case, we have a FileEntity which contains details about a file in a specific location. There are two child entities which are properties to FileEntity:
FileSize: stores the file size in bytes (and just stores a double value, so is small) FileContents: stores the contents of the file as a string (depending on the size of the file, this can obviously be very large) The contents of the file will not always be used and are potentially very large - so let&amp;rsquo;s look at how we can defer loading the data until it is actually used and required.</description></item></channel></rss>
