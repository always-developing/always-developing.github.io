This is done through the usage of RegisterPostInitializationOutput available to incremental generators.
This will make more sense as we look at an example. This example below is an extension of the example in last week&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;emitting source generated files&amp;rdquo; post.</description></item><item><title>Customize source generator output location</title><link>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/02/22-emit-source-generator-files/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 01:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://always-developing.github.io/dailydrop/2022/02/22-emit-source-generator-files/</guid><description>Daily Knowledge Drop The output location of code created by a Roslyn source generator can be customized, so that the output file can be included in source control (to be included in code reviews for example).
This post will give a brief overview of source generators, and then show the default behavior and how it can be customized.
This post will not go into detail regarding the finer details of source generators - if you would like more details on source generators, see the reference links below.</description></item><item><title>Roslyn Analyzer - tips and tricks (Part 5)</title><link>https://always-developing.github.io/p/analyzer-extra/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 05:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://always-developing.github.io/p/analyzer-extra/</guid><description>All posts in the series:

Code fix introduction As detailed in the previous post in the series, now that there is a working analyzer which accurately reports diagnostic information to Roslyn, the next step is to write the code fix to resolve the diagnostic.</description></item><item><title>Roslyn Analyzer - writing the analyzer (Part 2)</title><link>https://always-developing.github.io/p/analyzer-write/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 02:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://always-developing.github.io/p/analyzer-write/</guid><description>All posts in the series:

Analyzer introduction To recap from the previous post in the series, an analyzer is a piece of code which inspects code (C# or Visual Basic) during design and compile time, and based on the results of the inspection, can trigger a diagnostic as an Error, Warning or as Information.</description></item><item><title>Roslyn Analyzer - explained (Part 1)</title><link>https://always-developing.github.io/p/analyzer-explained/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 01:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://always-developing.github.io/p/analyzer-explained/</guid><description>Series introduction This is a a five part series exploring the Roslyn analyzer and code fix functionality, how to successfully write and test a custom analyzer, as well as some useful tips and tricks for writing analyzers.
